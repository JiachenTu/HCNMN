v8.1 where we will provide the llm with more context, provide it with the context of 
we are using wordnet to select the hierarchies and the goal is to create three levels of abstractions of 
scene graph to better preesnet the visual states, and we provide it with fine-grained scene graph text 
representation together with the bbox info as spatial context and prompt it to first select the best 
mid-level representation, and then select the coarse, the goal is not to have the best compression rate, but
 be able to retain a abstract high-level info represetnation of the visual sstate and we can trace down the 
abstraction level to go from coarse-mid-fine to have more detailed info about the picture, let's try to 
first test whether the prompting can provide the good response and then continue to build the hwhole 
pipeline and we name this version as v8.1
