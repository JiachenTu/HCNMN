## Graph Merging Analysis

### Edge Reduction

As granularity becomes coarser:
- Objects merge into concepts
- Edges between objects of the same concept become self-loops (removed)
- Multiple edges between merged concepts are collapsed (weight increases)

### Information Loss

The reduction in edges represents relationships that become internalized when objects merge.
This is expected and demonstrates the abstraction at work.

**Note**: Graph visualizations show only inter-concept relationships.
Intra-concept relationships (within merged groups) are not shown but are preserved in the hierarchy.
