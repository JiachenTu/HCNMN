| instrumentality | 2 | keypad, phone |
| pointer finger | 1 | pointer finger |
| cell phone | 1 | cell phone |
| organ | 1 | ear |
| part | 1 | fingernail |
| person | 1 | man |
| organism | 1 | speaker |
| key pad | 1 | key pad |
| copyright symbol | 1 | copyright symbol |
| award | 1 | oscar |
| set | 1 | band |
| watch strap | 1 | watch strap |

|----------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| physical entity | 3 | 6 | artifact, external body part, organ |
| object | 2 | 8 | instrumentality, organism |
| abstraction | 2 | 2 | award, set |
| pointer finger | 1 | 1 | pointer finger |
| communicate | 1 | 1 | cell phone |
| thing | 1 | 1 | part |
| whole | 1 | 1 | person |
| key pad | 1 | 1 | key pad |
