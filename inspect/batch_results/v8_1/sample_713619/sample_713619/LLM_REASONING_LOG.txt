V8.1 LLM Reasoning Log
======================================================================

Object: light
  Fine: light
  Mid: physical phenomenon
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: emblem
  Fine: emblem
  Mid: decoration
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Emblem is a decorative element, which is a mid-level concept representing its function and form, while 'object' provides the coarse-level abstraction for its physical representation.

Object: street
  Fine: street
  Mid: road
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Street is a physical entity (coarse) and a way of transportation (road) in the scene context. It represents the highest level of abstraction in the hierarchy, capturing both its spatial and functional aspects.

Object: window
  Fine: window
  Mid: structure
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'window' is a physical object (object, depth 2), and a part of a structure (structure, depth 5), which captures its functional and structural role in the scene.

Object: car
  Fine: car
  Mid: artifact
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Car is an artifact, representing its functional and material components, and it can be abstracted as a physical entity, which is a higher-level abstraction.

Object: building
  Fine: building
  Mid: structure
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Structure is a higher-level concept that groups similar objects like building, car, and sidewalk, providing a meaningful and traceable abstraction that captures the overall scene context.

Object: sidewalk
  Fine: sidewalk
  Mid: way
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Way represents the functional relationship between objects, while physical entity captures the broader abstract concept of the sidewalk. This aligns with the task of creating a meaningful, traceable hierarchy.

Object: steps
  Fine: steps
  Mid: stairway
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Steps are a physical entity that can be abstracted as a stairway (coarse level) and further refined as a stairway (mid level), which captures their functional and structural roles in a scene.

Object: street.
  Fine: street.
  Mid: street.
  Coarse: street.
  Method: unknown
