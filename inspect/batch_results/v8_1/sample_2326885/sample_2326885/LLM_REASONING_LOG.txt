V8.1 LLM Reasoning Log
======================================================================

Object: surf board
  Fine: surf board
  Mid: surf board
  Coarse: surf board
  Method: unknown

Object: tracks
  Fine: tracks
  Mid: path
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Tracks are a physical entity (depth 1) that form a path (depth 5) connecting sand. This provides a meaningful, traceable abstraction for the object and its relationship.

Object: long hair
  Fine: long hair
  Mid: long hair
  Coarse: long hair
  Method: unknown

Object: woman
  Fine: woman
  Mid: organism
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Organism (d=5) best represents 'woman' as a mid-level category. It captures the biological aspect of the object, aligning with the semantic information and allowing progressive refinement towards a more detailed level.

Object: skirt
  Fine: skirt
  Mid: cloth covering
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'skirt' is a clothing item that is a physical object (object) and also a part of a cloth covering (cloth covering) in the scene context. This aligns with the two-stage selection criteria for mid-level and coarse-level concepts.

Object: beach
  Fine: beach
  Mid: beach
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Beach is a physical entity that can be abstracted as a geographical feature (mid-level), and it is most general in the coarse level as a physical entity.

Object: bad sentence
  Fine: bad sentence
  Mid: bad sentence
  Coarse: bad sentence
  Method: unknown

Object: surfboard
  Fine: surfboard
  Mid: board
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Board is the most specific and functional category representing 'surfboard', while 'object' is the coarsest level that captures the broader category of items in the scene.

Object: white motorcycle
  Fine: white motorcycle
  Mid: white motorcycle
  Coarse: white motorcycle
  Method: unknown

Object: short hair
  Fine: short hair
  Mid: short hair
  Coarse: short hair
  Method: unknown

Object: no motorcycle
  Fine: no motorcycle
  Mid: no motorcycle
  Coarse: no motorcycle
  Method: unknown

Object: sand
  Fine: sand
  Mid: material
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Material represents the physical nature of sand, aligning with its functional and semantic category as a substance. Abstraction captures the broader concept of sand in the scene context.

Object: man
  Fine: man
  Mid: organism
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Man is an organism (mid-level concept), and physical entity (coarse-level concept) captures the general domain of the object.

Object: shoes
  Fine: shoes
  Mid: situation
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)
