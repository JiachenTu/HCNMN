V8.1 LLM Reasoning Log
======================================================================

Object: faucet
  Fine: faucet
  Mid: device
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'faucet' is a device used for water supply, which aligns with the mid-level concept 'device' (depth 6) as it represents its functional purpose. The 'object' (depth 2) captures its physical form and position.

Object: door
  Fine: door
  Mid: structure
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Door is a structure (mid-level concept) and a physical entity (coarse-level concept) in the scene context.

Object: cubby
  Fine: cubby
  Mid: structure
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Cubby is an object (depth 2) and a part of a structure (depth 5), which best represents its functional and semantic role in the scene.

Object: overflow
  Fine: overflow
  Mid: action
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: wall
  Fine: wall
  Mid: structure
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Structure is the most general category for grouping similar objects, and 'wall' fits as a physical entity in the first level. It also aligns with the functional and semantic category of a physical object.

Object: lid
  Fine: lid
  Mid: tissue
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm

Object: toilet
  Fine: toilet
  Mid: structure
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'structure' concept represents the 'toilet' as a whole, encompassing its components and functions, which aligns with its role as a functional object. It captures both its physical structure and its purpose more cohesively than 'artifact' or 'area'.

Object: pipe
  Fine: pipe
  Mid: way
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Pipe is a functional element (way) and a physical entity (physical entity), making it a mid-level concept for representing its role in the scene.

Object: floor
  Fine: floor
  Mid: horizontal surface
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Floor is a physical entity (coarse level) and a horizontal surface (mid-level concept) that best captures its functional and semantic role in the scene context.

Object: cabinet
  Fine: cabinet
  Mid: furnishing
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Cabinet is a furniture item, which aligns with the 'physical entity' (depth 1) concept as the most general category, and 'furnishing' (depth 6) represents its functional and semantic role as a furniture item.

Object: towel ring
  Fine: towel ring
  Mid: strip
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Towel ring is a strip of fabric, which is a physical entity (coarse) and a strip in the middle level of the semantic hierarchy (strip) representing its functional and material properties.

Object: sink
  Fine: sink
  Mid: plumbing fixture
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'sink' is a plumbing fixture (mid-level concept) and a physical object (coarse-level concept). It best represents the high-level semantic information of being a functional element in the plumbing system.

Object: handle
  Fine: handle
  Mid: handle
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Handle is a functional part of a device, and 'physical entity' captures its general domain as a basic object in the scene context.
