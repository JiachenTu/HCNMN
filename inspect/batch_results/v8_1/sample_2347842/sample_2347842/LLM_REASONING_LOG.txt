V8.1 LLM Reasoning Log
======================================================================

Object: leg
  Fine: leg
  Mid: extremity
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'leg' is a body part (mid-level concept), which is a physical entity (coarse-level concept), and extremity is the most specific category that captures the function and structure of a leg in the scene context.

Object: bench
  Fine: bench
  Mid: furnishing
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'bench' is a furniture item that serves as a seating area, aligning with the concept 'furnishing' which represents furniture items and their functions. 'Physical entity' captures the general domain of objects in the scene context.

Object: edge
  Fine: edge
  Mid: boundary
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Edge is a boundary, which represents the connection between objects, and it is a physical entity. The boundary concept at the coarse level is the most general meaningful domain for grouping similar objects.

Object: person
  Fine: person
  Mid: organism
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Person is a living thing (organism) and a physical entity (physical entity) in the scene context. The organism level captures the functional and biological aspects, while the physical entity level captures the general domain of objects.

Object: skateboarder
  Fine: skateboarder
  Mid: skater
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm

Object: skateboard
  Fine: skateboard
  Mid: artifact
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Artifact (depth 4) represents the skaterboard as a functional item, while object (depth 2) captures its physical form and position in the scene. This aligns with the need for a mid-level abstraction that combines both functional and physical aspects.

Object: concrete
  Fine: concrete
  Mid: artifact
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Artifact (depth 4) represents the abstract concept of a concrete object, while physical entity (depth 1) provides the coarse-level abstraction for grouping similar objects. Artifact captures the functional and semantic essence of concrete in the scene context.

Object: shadow
  Fine: shadow
  Mid: semidarkness
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Shadow is a visual object that can be abstracted as a state of being, and semidarkness is a concept that captures its visual and functional properties.

Object: pants
  Fine: pants
  Mid: artifact
  Coarse: object
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: hair
  Fine: hair
  Mid: natural object
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Hair is a natural object (mid-level concept), which best represents its functional and semantic role in the scene context. It is a specific type of natural object and fits the coarse-level abstraction of a physical entity.

Object: shoe
  Fine: shoe
  Mid: footwear
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Footwear (d=6) is the most specific and functional category for 'shoe' as a mid-level concept, representing its function and classification. It aligns with the semantic hierarchy as it captures both the object's function and its classification.

Object: boy
  Fine: boy
  Mid: organism
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Boy is a living being, and 'organism' aligns with his functional and semantic category. 'Object' captures his physical form, which is a direct abstraction of his presence in the scene.

Object: shirt
  Fine: shirt
  Mid: artifact
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'shirt' object is a clothing item, which aligns with the mid-level concept 'artifact' (a tangible object that represents a garment). The 'physical entity' concept captures the most general domain for grouping similar objects like 'shirt'.

Object: people
  Fine: people
  Mid: group
  Coarse: group
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Grouping similar objects (people, bicycle, skateboard, etc.) at the mid-level provides meaningful semantic grouping and allows for progressive refinement, preserving the overall context of the scene.

Object: skate park
  Fine: skate park
  Mid: skate park
  Coarse: skate park
  Method: unknown

Object: bicycle
  Fine: bicycle
  Mid: conveyance
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Bicycle is a conveyance, which is a mid-level concept representing its function, while object is the coarse-level concept representing its physical form.

Object: ramp
  Fine: ramp
  Mid: device
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'ramp' is a device that functions as an inclined plane, which fits as a mid-level concept (device) and serves as a physical entity (coarse) in the hierarchical abstraction.

Object: grass
  Fine: grass
  Mid: plant
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Grass is a plant, which is a higher-level concept (mid) and best represents the general category of objects in the scene context. It aligns with the WordNet path and provides a meaningful abstraction.

Object: writing
  Fine: writing
  Mid: activity
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)
