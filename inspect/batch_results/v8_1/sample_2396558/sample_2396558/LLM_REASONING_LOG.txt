V8.1 LLM Reasoning Log
======================================================================

Object: top
  Fine: top
  Mid: top
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Top is a physical object with a specific location and position, making it a coarse-level concept. The mid-level concept 'top' represents its functional role in the scene, while the coarse concept 'physical entity' captures its general semantic domain.

Object: middle
  Fine: middle
  Mid: area
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Middle is a spatial location (area) and represents the position and size of the object, aligning with the coarse level of abstraction (physical entity) while capturing its mid-level semantic information (area).

Object: bruise
  Fine: bruise
  Mid: physical condition
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: bruise is a physical condition that describes the state of a body, making it a suitable mid-level concept for representing its functional and semantic role in the scene context.

Object: sticker
  Fine: sticker
  Mid: process
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'sticker' object is a physical entity (coarse level) and its function (process) best represents its role as a visual object in the scene context. This aligns with the goal of creating a meaningful, traceable hierarchy.

Object: oranges
  Fine: oranges
  Mid: plant organ
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm

Object: branch
  Fine: branch
  Mid: unit
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: table
  Fine: table
  Mid: array
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Table is an array of objects (array) and represents a high-level abstraction of the scene context. It captures the structure and arrangement of objects, aligning with the need for a progressive abstraction from the coarse to the fine level.

Object: light
  Fine: light
  Mid: physical phenomenon
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: group
  Fine: group
  Mid: group
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Group represents a semantic category for grouping similar objects, while abstraction provides the most general meaningful domain for grouping. The group is a mid-level concept, and abstraction is the coarse-level concept.

Object: apple
  Fine: apple
  Mid: plant part
  Coarse: object
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: shape
  Fine: shape
  Mid: shape
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Shape is a mid-level category representing the object's physical form, while abstraction captures its general meaning as a concept, and abstraction is the most general domain for grouping similar objects.

Object: lemon
  Fine: lemon
  Mid: plant organ
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Lemon is a plant organ (mid-level) and a physical entity (coarse-level) that best captures its general semantic category and provides a meaningful abstraction.

Object: orange
  Fine: orange
  Mid: plant organ
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Orange is a plant organ (mid-level concept) and a physical entity (coarse-level concept), aligning with the semantic hierarchy of the scene context.

Object: banana
  Fine: banana
  Mid: plant
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Banana is a plant (mid-level concept) and a physical object (coarse-level concept), aligning with the semantic hierarchy for grouping similar objects.

Object: fruit
  Fine: fruit
  Mid: plant organ
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Fruit is a plant organ, which is a more specific category than a plant part (depth 5) and a physical entity (depth 1), aligning with the hierarchical abstraction requirement of progressing from coarse to mid to fine.

Object: spot
  Fine: spot
  Mid: point
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Point (depth 4) best represents 'spot' as a mid-level concept, capturing its location within a scene. 'Physical entity' (depth 1) provides the coarse-level abstraction, grouping similar objects like 'lemon' and 'banana' by their physical properties.

Object: tip
  Fine: tip
  Mid: extremity
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The tip is a specific point of a stem, which can be considered an extremity (mid-level concept) as it represents a specific part of an object. The physical entity provides a broader abstraction, capturing the tip as a part of a physical object.

Object: bump
  Fine: bump
  Mid: physical condition
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Bump is a physical object with a condition, which aligns with the coarse-level abstraction of 'abstraction' and the mid-level concept 'physical condition' representing its functional and semantic category.

Object: bottom
  Fine: bottom
  Mid: region
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Bottom is a region (depth 4) and represents a physical entity (depth 1) in the scene context.

Object: pile
  Fine: pile
  Mid: collection
  Coarse: collection
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'collection' concept best represents 'pile' as a mid-level category in this scene context. It groups similar objects (the pile) and provides a meaningful abstraction that captures the core semantic information of the pile.

Object: stem
  Fine: stem
  Mid: word
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)
