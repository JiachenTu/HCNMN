V8.1 LLM Reasoning Log
======================================================================

Object: vase
  Fine: vase
  Mid: container
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Vase is a container (mid-level concept) and a physical entity (coarse-level concept) that best represents the object in the scene context.

Object: flower
  Fine: flower
  Mid: organism
  Coarse: object
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: board
  Fine: board
  Mid: unit
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Board is a physical object (coarse abstraction) that can be grouped into a unit (mid-level concept) representing its functional role in the scene.

Object: chair
  Fine: chair
  Mid: furnishing
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Chair is a furniture item, which fits as a mid-level category (furnishing) and a physical entity, which fits as the coarse-level abstraction (physical entity). This aligns with the semantic hierarchy.

Object: pink
  Fine: pink
  Mid: color
  Coarse: attribute
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Pink is a color, and color is a mid-level concept that represents the visual property of the object. It aligns with the semantic category of the object and provides a meaningful abstraction for grouping.

Object: back
  Fine: back
  Mid: back
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'back' object is a physical entity, which provides the most general meaningful domain for grouping similar objects (e.g., furniture, objects). It represents the highest level of abstraction as a physical entity.

Object: chairs
  Fine: chairs
  Mid: furnishing
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Chairs are functional furniture items and best represented as 'furnishing' (mid-level category) since it groups furniture objects with functional roles. 'Physical entity' (coarse) captures the general category of furniture items.

Object: flowers
  Fine: flowers
  Mid: plant
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Flowers are a type of plant, which is a mid-level category (plant) and the most general meaningful domain for grouping similar objects. This aligns with the scene context and semantic hierarchy.

Object: mat
  Fine: mat
  Mid: covering
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'mat' is a covering object, which is a physical entity (depth 1) and best represents its functional role as a covering surface in the scene.

Object: tips
  Fine: tips
  Mid: extremity
  Coarse: object
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: babys breath
  Fine: babys breath
  Mid: babys breath
  Coarse: babys breath
  Method: unknown

Object: dining table
  Fine: dining table
  Mid: furnishing
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Furnishing is the most general mid-level concept that captures the function and purpose of objects like a dining table. It aligns with the scene context, which describes dining tables as furniture objects.

Object: cabinet
  Fine: cabinet
  Mid: furnishing
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Furnishing is the most general category that best represents 'cabinet' as a functional and structural object, aligning with its role in a scene.

Object: crack
  Fine: crack
  Mid: amorphous shape
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm

Object: table
  Fine: table
  Mid: table
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'table' is a physical object with semantic meaning (a table), and it best represents a mid-level abstraction as a category that includes other objects with similar semantic roles.

Object: tops
  Fine: tops
  Mid: top
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Tops is a specific object in the scene, and 'top' represents a mid-level category that captures its position relative to other objects, while 'object' is the coarse-level abstraction that encompasses all objects in the scene.

Object: chair back
  Fine: chair back
  Mid: chair back
  Coarse: chair back
  Method: unknown

Object: drawer
  Fine: drawer
  Mid: structure
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'drawer' is a physical object (coarse) and a structure (mid) that contains other objects. It best represents the general concept of a storage or container.

Object: handle
  Fine: handle
  Mid: handle
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Handle is a functional component of a drawer and represents the most general meaningful domain for grouping similar objects.
