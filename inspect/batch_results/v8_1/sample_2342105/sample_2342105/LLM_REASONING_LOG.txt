V8.1 LLM Reasoning Log
======================================================================

Object: ground
  Fine: ground
  Mid: land
  Coarse: object
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: blue shirt
  Fine: blue shirt
  Mid: blue shirt
  Coarse: blue shirt
  Method: unknown

Object: red kite
  Fine: red kite
  Mid: red kite
  Coarse: red kite
  Method: unknown

Object: woman and boy
  Fine: woman and boy
  Mid: woman and boy
  Coarse: woman and boy
  Method: unknown

Object: shirt
  Fine: shirt
  Mid: commodity
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Commodity represents the functional/semantic category of a clothing item, aligning with the object 'shirt' as a clothing item. It is a mid-level concept that captures its use and value in the scene context.

Object: man
  Fine: man
  Mid: person
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Man is a person, which aligns with the semantic category 'person' at the mid-level. 'Physical entity' captures the most general domain for grouping similar objects like man, woman, boy, etc.

Object: people
  Fine: people
  Mid: group
  Coarse: people
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: People are grouped together in the scene context, forming a coherent set of objects, and they represent a high-level semantic category that allows for meaningful abstraction.

Object: strings
  Fine: strings
  Mid: section
  Coarse: group
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Strings are grouped into sections, which is a mid-level abstraction that captures their functional role as part of a larger structure. The 'group' concept represents the coarse level, while the 'section' concept provides the finer level of detail.

Object: down
  Fine: down
  Mid: material
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm

Object: hands
  Fine: hands
  Mid: group action
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: building
  Fine: building
  Mid: structure
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Building is a structure, which is a more general category than an object but still captures its functional and spatial characteristics. It is the most appropriate high-level abstraction for representing 'building' in this scene context.

Object: clouds
  Fine: clouds
  Mid: cloud
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Clouds represent a natural phenomenon (mid-level concept) and are physical entities (coarse-level concept) in the scene context.

Object: cones
  Fine: cones
  Mid: cone
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Cones are a specific type of object (mid-level concept) and belong to the broader category of physical entities (coarse-level concept)

Object: blue
  Fine: blue
  Mid: color
  Coarse: attribute
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The concept 'color' represents the semantic category of the object 'blue', which is a visual property. It captures the functional and semantic meaning of the object as a color. This aligns with the goal of creating a meaningful, traceable abstraction level.

Object: kite
  Fine: kite
  Mid: document
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Kite is a visual object, and 'document' represents a written or recorded form of information. 'Abstraction' captures the conceptual representation of the object, aligning with its functional role as a visual element.

Object: ladybug kites
  Fine: ladybug kites
  Mid: ladybug kites
  Coarse: ladybug kites
  Method: unknown

Object: kites
  Fine: kites
  Mid: document
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Document is a high-level abstraction that groups similar objects like 'kites' as a medium of communication and information. It aligns with the task of creating a meaningful, traceable hierarchy.

Object: bag
  Fine: bag
  Mid: container
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'bag' is a container, which represents its functional role as a storage or holding unit. It is a physical object, making it the most appropriate coarse-level concept for abstraction.

Object: tail
  Fine: tail
  Mid: tail
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'tail' is a physical entity that represents the body part of an object. It is a coarse-level concept as it captures the overall physical representation of an object.

Object: boy
  Fine: boy
  Mid: person
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Person (mid) represents the abstract category of the object 'boy', which is a human. The physical entity (coarse) captures the object 'boy' as a tangible entity in the scene.

Object: sky
  Fine: sky
  Mid: sky
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Sky is a physical entity (coarse) and the most general category representing its location and atmosphere (mid-level concept)

Object: woman
  Fine: woman
  Mid: person
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'person' concept represents 'woman' as a human being, aligning with the semantic category of a living being. The 'physical entity' concept captures the broader, more general domain of the object, making it the appropriate high-level abstraction for the scene context.
