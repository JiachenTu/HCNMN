V8.1 LLM Reasoning Log
======================================================================

Object: clock
  Fine: clock
  Mid: instrumentality
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Clock is an instrument/tool (mid-level concept) and a physical object (coarse-level concept). This aligns with the semantic hierarchy: instrumentality is a functional category, and object represents the actual physical entity.

Object: sign
  Fine: sign
  Mid: sign
  Coarse: communication
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Sign is a direct representation of a visual element used for communication, which aligns with the high-level abstraction at the coarse level. It also serves as a form of indication, which is a mid-level concept, and fits the semantic hierarchy as a clue to further abstracting into evidence.

Object: flower
  Fine: flower
  Mid: plant
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'flower' object is a plant (mid-level concept) and represents a specific type of plant (object-level concept) in the WordNet ontology.

Object: pot
  Fine: pot
  Mid: artifact
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'pot' is a physical object, and 'artifact' represents its functional role as a cooking utensil. This aligns with the goal of creating a meaningful, traceable hierarchy that reflects both its physical form and its function.

Object: stairs
  Fine: stairs
  Mid: stairway
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Stairs are a physical entity (coarse) and represent a functional pathway (stairway) at the mid-level abstraction.

Object: edge
  Fine: edge
  Mid: boundary
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'edge' is a boundary, which is the most general concept representing its functional role. It also aligns with the coarse level of 'physical entity' as the highest level of abstraction.

Object: letter
  Fine: letter
  Mid: artifact
  Coarse: object
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: background
  Fine: background
  Mid: background
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: street
  Fine: street
  Mid: road
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'road' concept captures the core semantic role of 'street' as a functional entity. It aligns with the high-level abstraction and provides a meaningful grouping of similar objects.

Object: flowers
  Fine: flowers
  Mid: organism
  Coarse: object
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: lot
  Fine: lot
  Mid: large indefinite quantity
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm

Object: words
  Fine: words
  Mid: words
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm

Object: railing
  Fine: railing
  Mid: structure
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Railing is a structural element of a building, representing a physical entity (depth 1), which is a part of a structure (depth 5) that can be further refined to a more detailed structure (depth 6) as the mid-level concept.

Object: balcony
  Fine: balcony
  Mid: balcony
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Balcony is a physical object (coarse level) and represents a structure (mid level) that is a part of a larger scene (fine level). It best captures its functional and semantic role as a mid-level category.

Object: billboard
  Fine: billboard
  Mid: structure
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Billboard is a structure (mid-level concept) that can be grouped with other structures like signboards, while physical entities like the billboard itself are the coarse level abstraction for this object.

Object: face
  Fine: face
  Mid: face
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Face is a specific part of the body, which is a physical entity. It represents the most general meaningful domain for grouping similar objects.

Object: pole
  Fine: pole
  Mid: instrumentality
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'pole' is a physical object (coarse) and represents a functional or operational element (instrumentality), which aligns with the mid-level concept of instrumentality. It reflects both its physical form and its role in the scene.

Object: light
  Fine: light
  Mid: physical phenomenon
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Light is a physical phenomenon (mid-level concept) that represents a physical entity (coarse-level concept) in the scene context.
