V8.1 LLM Reasoning Log
======================================================================

Object: leg
  Fine: leg
  Mid: external body part
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'leg' object is best represented as an 'external body part' (mid-level concept) since it is a specific body part. The 'physical entity' (coarse-level concept) captures the general representation of the object, which is consistent with the semantic hierarchy.

Object: air
  Fine: air
  Mid: air
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Air is a physical entity (depth 1) and a fluid (depth 3) in the WordNet hierarchy. It best represents 'air' as a mid-level category in this scene context.

Object: ground
  Fine: ground
  Mid: land
  Coarse: object
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: shirt
  Fine: shirt
  Mid: artifact
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'shirt' object is best represented as an artifact (mid-level concept) since it is a tangible object that can be used or worn, and as an object (coarse-level concept) it is a physical item in the scene. This aligns with the semantic hierarchy as described.

Object: headband
  Fine: headband
  Mid: band
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Headband is a physical object, and 'band' at the mid level represents its functional and semantic category, while 'physical entity' at the coarse level provides the most general domain for grouping similar objects.

Object: letters
  Fine: letters
  Mid: basic cognitive process
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: dirt
  Fine: dirt
  Mid: material
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: foot
  Fine: foot
  Mid: extremity
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'foot' is a physical object, and 'extremity' represents its functional or structural part, aligning with its role in the scene. 'Physical entity' captures the general abstraction, while 'extremity' reflects the detailed level of refinement.

Object: ball
  Fine: ball
  Mid: artifact
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: The 'ball' is a physical object (object level), and the 'artifact' represents its functional or material aspect. It fits as a mid-level concept for representing 'ball' as a general object.

Object: woman
  Fine: woman
  Mid: person
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Person (depth 6) represents the 'woman' as a human, which aligns with the semantic category of a living being, and the 'object' (depth 2) captures the specific object in the scene context.

Object: shoe
  Fine: shoe
  Mid: footwear
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Footwear is a mid-level category that represents the concept of a shoe, aligning with its functional and semantic attributes. It groups similar objects like shoes and covers their position and size.

Object: hair
  Fine: hair
  Mid: natural object
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Hair is a natural object (mid-level concept), and it belongs to a physical entity (coarse-level concept) in the scene context.

Object: racket
  Fine: racket
  Mid: sound
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: writing
  Fine: writing
  Mid: activity
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: wall
  Fine: wall
  Mid: partition
  Coarse: physical entity
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Partition is the most general meaning for grouping similar objects, and 'wall' fits as a partition in this context. It represents a specific object with a defined structure.

Object: shorts
  Fine: shorts
  Mid: trouser
  Coarse: object
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Trousers are a clothing item that serves a functional purpose, aligning with the semantic category of clothing (mid-level) and representing the object 'shorts' as a garment.

Object: court
  Fine: court
  Mid: assembly
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: fallback
  Reasoning: Adaptive rule-based fallback (V7)

Object: background
  Fine: background
  Mid: background
  Coarse: abstraction
  Method: llm
  Reasoning: Background is a mid-level concept that represents the overall scene context, grouping related objects (e.g., ground, background) by their semantic and functional roles. It serves as the most general abstraction for the scene.
