🎯 ONTOLOGY EXPANSION:
   11 base objects → 467 concepts (42.5x expansion)

📊 HIERARCHY STRUCTURE:
   14 levels (specific → abstract)
   
   Level 0-2:   98 concepts (21%) - Fine-grained    [seagull, sand, wing]
   Level 3-5:  159 concepts (34%) - Mid-level       [bird, material, object]
   Level 6-14: 210 concepts (45%) - Coarse-grained  [entity, abstraction]

🌳 EXAMPLE PATHS (Specific → Abstract):

   seagull → bird → vertebrate → animal → organism → living thing 
            → whole → object → physical entity → entity (14 levels)

   sand → soil → material → substance → part → relation 
         → abstraction → entity (8 levels)

   wing → appendage → body part → natural object → whole 
         → object → physical entity → entity (10 levels)

✨ KEY INSIGHTS:

   1. Living things (seagull, bird) have DEEPER hierarchies (14 levels)
      than inanimate objects (sand, pebble: 8-9 levels)

   2. Multiple concepts CONVERGE to shared abstract parents:
      - seagull, bird, wing → living thing → entity
      - sand, dirt, ground → substance → entity

   3. Mid-levels (L3-L6) have MOST concepts due to convergence

   4. The hierarchy is INVERTED PYRAMID:
      - Many specific concepts at bottom
      - Few abstract concepts at top
      - Single root: "entity"

🎓 WHAT IS ONTOLOGY FORMULATION?

   The process of organizing concepts into a hierarchical knowledge structure
   that captures relationships from SPECIFIC instances to ABSTRACT categories.

   This enables MULTI-GRANULARITY REASONING:
   - "Is there a seagull?" → L0 (specific)
   - "Is there a bird?" → L5 (category)
   - "Are there living things?" → L10 (abstract)

   The model can answer questions at ANY abstraction level!

🔧 HOW IT WORKS:

   1. Start with VG objects (seagull, sand, wing...)
   2. For each object, query WordNet for synsets
   3. For each synset, traverse ALL hypernym paths to root
   4. Collect concepts at each depth level
   5. Result: Multi-granularity hierarchy with 42.5x expansion

📈 STATISTICS:

   Base concepts:              11
   Expanded concepts:         467
   Expansion ratio:          42.5x
   Max hierarchy depth:        14 levels
   Avg depth per concept:     6.5 levels
   WordNet coverage:         100% (all objects mapped)
